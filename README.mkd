AUR firefox-beta
================

Fork of the Archlinux AUR [firefox-beta package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-beta/) with small
additions:
* Enable PGO
* Disable telemetry and crash reports
* Fix the installation path to be able to install it side by side with firefox stable
* Lower memory consumption during compilation (but makes it a bit slower)
